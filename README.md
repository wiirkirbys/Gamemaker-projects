# Gamemaker-projects
Projects made in GameMaker Studio 2.
All of these projects were made alone.

Each Assignment is fairly self-explanatory, both for controls and gameplay.

Final Project is a turn-based RPG, basic controls are in a text file in the folder itself.
Note that the third ability for each character cannot be used unless there is an exclamation point next to it.

Bonus Project was an extra credit project for Theoretical Computer Science. It's supposed to showcase how cellular automata work.
The goal is to cover each "target" with a cell by placing the inital cell somewhere in the grid above it.
