# Gamemaker-projects
Projects made in GameMaker Studio 2.
All of these projects were made alone.

Each Assignment is fairly self-explanatory, both for controls and gameplay.

Final Project is a turn-based RPG, basic controls are in a text file in the folder itself.
Note that the third ability for each character cannot be used unless there is an exclamation point next to it.

Bonus Project was an extra credit project for Theoretical Computer Science. It's supposed to showcase how cellular automata work.
The goal is to cover each "target" with a cell by placing the inital cell somewhere in the grid above it.

GMToolkit 2021 Jam was an attempted game for the GameMaker Toolkit game jam in June 2021.
It is unfinished due to falling ill before the deadline, but the basic mechanics are functional (although there is no executable since it was never built).
